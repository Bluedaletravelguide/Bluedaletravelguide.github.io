            <h2 class="h2">KLCC</h2>

            <p>
                KLCC, the crowning jewel of Malaysia, was designed by the architect Cesar Pelli. The 88-storey towers, at an altitude of 451.9 metres, were the tallest skyscrapers in the world until 2004.

                <p>
                    Something unique about the KLCC is the 58-metre-long double-storey sky bridge that connects the two towers on the 41st and 42nd floors (170 meters above the street level). Interestingly, the sky bridge is not completely connected to the main building. The sky bridge was intentionally designed by engineers to allow small movements during high winds and other unpleasant weather conditions.

                    The Union Flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was hoisted at this very spot at midnight on 31 August 1957 as Malaya declared independence from the British rule. That is why this spot is known as Dataran Merdeka which directly translates to Independence Square and has been where the Independence day parade took place until it was later moved to Putrajaya. Merdeka Square appears to be nothing more than a colossal field of beautifully manicured green lawns and the centerpiece of the tallest flagpole in the world (95 m) proudly displaying the Jalur Gemilang (Malaysian flag).

            <p>
                Sultan Abdul Samad Building is one of the early Moorish-style buildings in Kuala Lumpur. It is located to the east of Merdeka Square (Dataran Merdeka) and the Royal Selangor Club, across from Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin. It was built in 1897 and at that time was named after the reigning Sultan of Selangor.

                    The Sultan Abdul Samad originally housed the offices of the British colonial administration, and was known simply as Government Offices in its early years. In 1974 it was renamed after Sultan Abdul Samad, the reigning sultan of Selangor at the time. This once housed the superior courts of the country: the Federal Court of Malaysia, the Court of Appeal and the High Court of Malaysia. In the early 2000s, the Federal Court and the Court of Appeals moved to the Palace of Justice in Putrajaya, while the High Court of Malaya moved to the Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex in 2007. Today, the building houses both the offices of the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia and the Ministry of Tourism and Culture of Malaysia.

            <p>
                The Kuala Lumpur Tower is the seventh tallest telecommunications tower in the world and the tallest in Southeast Asia. It is located in the centre of Malaysia's capital city, Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia is widely regarded as a cultural melting pot among various religions and races. KL Tower hosts vibrant cultural events during the year. On a daily basis, our experienced in-house culture troupe stages traditional dances. Since 1999, KL Tower has hosted the longest-running urban BASE (Building, Antenna, Distance, Earth) phenomenon. The Observation Deck provides breathtaking views of the Kuala Lumpur skyline from 276 metres above the ground.

                    Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve, one of the country's oldest forest reserves, is home to KL Tower. In fact, KL Tower is the world's only tree-housed tower. Despite the fact that the KL Tower was built to improve the quality of telecommunications and broadcast transmission in the country, it has since become a significant landmark and symbol that defines Malaysia as a nation coming of age.
